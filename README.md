# word-selection-ai-project
AI Word Assistant is a Chrome extension that makes online reading smarter and more interactive.
While reading articles, Wikipedia pages, or blogs, users often encounter words they don’t understand or can’t pronounce — this tool solves that problem.

With just a simple word selection, the extension:
Detects the selected word
Displays a friendly AI face
Speaks the correct pronunciation
Shows an easy-to-understand meaning
Automatically saves the word to a personal “Word History”

This project transforms regular reading into an interactive vocabulary-learning experience, helping users build their language skills naturally as they browse.
Can I keep this in the GitHub project description? Is it long or is it okay to keep long description?
